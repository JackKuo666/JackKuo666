The 2024 Nobel Prizes in Physics and Chemistry were awarded to the fields of artificial intelligence and AI-driven life sciences, respectively. This landmark event heralds to the world that we are now in the midst of a paradigm-shifting revolution in scientific research, spearheaded by AI.  

As we stand today, the exploration of life sciences has fully entered the era of LLMs. Leveraging vast datasets and immense computational power for training and optimization, these LLMs have demonstrated unparalleled advantages in precision, efficiency, transferability, and emergent capabilities. They are now pushing the boundaries of human understanding of life's complexity in ways never before imagined.  

The transformative impact of LLMs on scientific research extends far beyond algorithmic performance. More profoundly, they have catalyzed the emergence of a new generation of infrastructure and platform systems, shifting the paradigm of scientific discovery from isolated model breakthroughs to an end-to-end intelligent closed loop. This enables autonomous decision-making, dynamic optimization, and continuous evolution for high-complexity, large-scale research tasks.
